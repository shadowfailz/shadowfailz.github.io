	<h2>History </h2><br>
	Samhain was the principal feast day of the year; it was the New Year's Day of a year that began on 1
	November. Traditionally, bonfires were lit as part of the celebration. It was believed that the spirits 
	of those who had died during the previous twelve months were granted access into the otherworld during
	Samhain. Thus, spirits were said to be traveling on that evening, as the Celtic day was counted from 
	sundown to sundown.<br>

	Scholars know little about the actual practices and beliefs associated with Samhain. Most accounts were not 
	written down until centuries after the conversion of Ireland to Christianity (c. 300 C.E.), and then by 
	Christian monks recording ancient sagas. From the evidence, we know that Samhain was a focal point of the 
	yearly cycle, and that traditions of leaving out offerings of food and drink to comfort the wandering spirits
	had joined the bonfire custom. Also, the tradition of mumming—dressing in disguise and performing from home 
	to home in exchange for food or drink, as well as pranking, perhaps in imitation of the wandering spirits,
	or simply as a customary activity found throughout Europe—had become part of the occasion. With the
	acceptance of Christianity, the dates of the pre-Christian festivals were used as occasions for church
	feast and holy days. The first day of November became, in the sixth century, the Feast of All Saints, or 
	All Hallows. Many of the folk traditions surrounding this occasion continued, and the Eve of All Hallows, 
	Hallow Evening, has become conflated into the word "Hallowe'en." In the ninth century, 2 November was 
	assigned the Feast of All Souls, a day set aside for prayers for all the faithful departed who had died 
	during the previous year.<br>

	Halloween was brought to North America with Irish and British colonists, although it was not widely observed 
	until the large influx of European immigrants in the nineteenth century, especially the Irish fleeing the
	potato famine in the 1840s and thereafter. In the United States, Hallowe'en, celebrated on 31 October,
	was a time for parties and pranking. As a festival of autumn, the fruits, vegetables, and foods associated
	with it are those of the harvest. Games were and are still played with apples, and the primary symbol of 
	Halloween is the jack-o'-lantern, the great, carved pumpkin. Likewise, both apple pie and pumpkin pie 
	are commonly served.<br>
