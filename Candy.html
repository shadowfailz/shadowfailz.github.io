	<b>So what happened to make candy so central to the holiday?</b><br>
	Definitely marketing. Starting in the 1950s, big candy manufacturers started putting out a
	lot more Halloween promotions. But candy also was viewed in the 1950s and 1960s as a more acceptable 
	treat. Kids, of course, really like it. And convenience was probably a big factor for the women who were
	handing out the treats. Candy was pre-packaged and portioned,if you bake cookies or make popcorn balls
	you have to wrap them, you know. 
<br>
	Also, in the 1970s, there was the emergence of the myth of the Halloween sadist; the idea that there are
	people out there who are going to poison the popcorn balls, put razors in the apples, etc. Anything that
	was not factory sealed was not considered safe. We did not trust the handmade, the unmarked or unbranded.
	Which is hugely ironic, because in the early 20th century it was the factory-made candy that was viewed
	as suspicious when it was first introduced! 
<br>
	Even though it has since been established that the Halloween sadist was an urban legend, there was a sense of loss of small-townness 
	in that era of suburbanization.The neighbors were strangers for the first time. Fear of the neighbors candy sort of captured that 
	sense of loss of community candies and focus on his most popular product, peanut butter cups. In 1963, Hershey acquired the H.B Reese Candy Company.
